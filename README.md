# I've lost access to this account because of 2FA faultyness. This account is abandoned and I have moved to https://github.com/adryd325

A couple months ago I replaced my 2FA authenticator and needed to change the seed and such. I did so and it worked fine for a couple weeks until it became inconsistant and half the time I would fail to log in. Now nothing at all works, My 2FA recovery codes don't work, my code generator won't work and the seed I saved doesn't work so I've been forced to move to a new account.
